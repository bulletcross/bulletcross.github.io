I have been blogging for some time, hosting content on wordpress, google sites,
and wix. Most of them are either outdated (too old and basic content), or I lost
interest in maintaining them, partially because of so many steps to post and edit contents.
For example, wordpress was great[here is the link](https://expelliarm.wordpress.com)  and I thought I would be writing articles
on some ML topics atleast every month. But I could not do so, for the reasons I
just gave. Wordpress had great tools, to monitor views (an android application)
and ad space to make some extra bucks (for those in needs). But cluttered system
was what that pushed me away from posting anymore. I guess, same holds for other blogs.

It has been long since I have left writing stuffs (and sometimes interesting stuffs),
I have found myself reading or consuming science content more and more, most of them are medium articles on
on computer science, finance, machine learning, mathematics, blockchains and what not.
I assume that the knowledge on core topics (or rather hot topics) like machine learning
blockchain and quantum computing has increased among students and professionals,
partially because of knowledge shared by many through many mediums (medium.com) in a very lucid way.

I re-discovered github.io as the best tool to publish content without any hassel. Since there
are no excuses left to make, I have decided to start sharing my ideas and knowlege and re-blogging.
Unlike previous un-managed blogs on random topics (I still dont know how did I get many views on those)
I will try to categorize contents this time. Without much of chit-chat now, I think it's a good time
to end here, my first blog on my personal github.io page.
